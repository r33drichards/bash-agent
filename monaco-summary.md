# Monaco Editor Integration Summary

## What Was Implemented

We successfully added a Monaco code editor feature to the bash-agent project. The feature allows users to edit files directly in the browser without having to use the chat interface or terminal commands.

### Key Components

1. **Monaco Editor Interface**:
   - Created a dedicated web page with Monaco editor integration
   - Added syntax highlighting for many programming languages
   - Implemented file browser for easy file selection
   - Added file operations: viewing, editing, saving, and creating new files

2. **Backend Integration**:
   - Created Flask routes to handle file operations
   - Implemented API endpoints for file listing, reading, and writing
   - Integrated with the main bash-agent application through Blueprint registration

3. **UI Integration**:
   - Added a link to the Monaco editor from the main chat interface
   - Created a consistent UI style that matches the bash-agent theme

## Files Created/Modified

- **New Files**:
  - `monaco_routes.py`: Backend routes for Monaco editor
  - `templates/monaco.html`: Monaco editor interface
  - `MONACO.md`: Documentation for the Monaco editor feature

- **Modified Files**:
  - `agent.py`: Added Blueprint registration
  - `templates/index.html`: Added link to Monaco editor

## How to Test

1. Start the bash-agent server:
   ```bash
   python agent.py
   ```

2. Access the Monaco editor by:
   - Clicking the "Monaco Editor" button in the top right of the main chat interface, or
   - Navigating directly to `/monaco`

3. Use the file browser to select files and test editing functionality

## Future Improvements

- Recursive file browser with folder support
- Search functionality within files
- Multiple file tabs for editing several files at once
- Git integration for viewing changes and committing
- More advanced file operations (rename, delete, etc.)
